context,,,
context can contain any value, it can be a object also,
context using context hook,,,
but context is using separately, not in App.js
a component named 'AuthContextProvider' is formed, & wrapper up by <App /> component in index.js  
---------
pass data from a parent component to its descendant components, 
without the need to pass the data through props or intermediate components. => createContext

createContext =>
for using context thorough components, we have to do two things.
we have to provide it & we have to listen to it. 


<AuthContext.Provider value={CONTEXT}> = this provides the context through the childs & 'value' is a keyword here.

again, there are also two ways to listen the context.
<AuthContext.Consumer> {(context) => {}}  --->>> Consumer takes a child which returns a function & that function holds the context.

&

useContext hook -->> const ctx = useContext(CONTEXT) **we can access our context in this way** 
In this module module-10_4, we are using useContext hook.
