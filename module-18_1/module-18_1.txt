local => belongs to single component,, 
we use useState/useReducer hook
ex: listeing input, toggling 'show more' etc.

cross-component => affecst multiple components,, 
we use useState/useReducer but need to build props chains.
ex: open/close modal

app-wide state => affects entire app 
we use useState/useReducer but need to build props chains.
ex: user-authentication

context/redux helps to manage the cross component or app-wide state.
