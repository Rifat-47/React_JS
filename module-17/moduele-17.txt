Customers can add or remove meal items to the cart & see the total expense.
Then, customer can confirm their order by user information & information are saved in the database through api.

api for fetching data: 'https://module-17-1-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/meals.json'

useReducer is used here to update the cart &
useRef is used to take input from customers.
useContext is used to share the cart among different areas of our project.
useEffect is used in the header button of navigation bar for a little bump when new item is added or removed.

###
async funtion always returns a promise. 
if we throw error inside of a promise, that error will cause that promise to reject.
