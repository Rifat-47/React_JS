Module-18 Diving into redux
tutorial: 16-23
NB: in redux, don't mutate the object, create a brand new object. 
----------------------------------------
Project Name: Redux using redux toolkit
Project description: here, redux is made of 2 slices. 
one indicated the counter & another indicates the login & logout functionality.

install:
    npm install @reduxjs/toolkit

using redux toolkit, we may think, we are mutating the object, but actually not, those are handled by redux toolkit under the hood.

configureStore => creates a Redux store.

createSlice => creates a slice of redux store 

useSelector => give the current snapshot of something
