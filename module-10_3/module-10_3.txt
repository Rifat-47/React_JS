context,,,

pass data from a parent component to its descendant components,

createContext =>
for using context thorough components, we have to do two things.
we have to provide it & we have to listen to it. 


<AuthContext.Provider value={CONTEXT}> = this provides the context through the childs & 'value' is a keyword here.

<AuthContext.Consumer> {(context) => {}}  --->>> Consumer takes a child which returns a function & that function holds the context.
In this module module-10_3, we have used <AuthContext.Consumer>
